Application of ML for Pricing: Basket option pricing using Neural Network
Note: This is a personal initiative to support my application for the data scientist role.

============================================================================================

Context: The client wants to explore novel methodologies for accelerating the pricing of exotic derivatives.  

Goal:  
● Build and train a neural network model for pricing European Basket options under Black Scholes assumptions.  
● Compare prices to a traditional numerical solver such as Monte-Carlo, Finite Difference or any other methodology you may deem applicable. 
● Compare both to the analytical solution in the 1 asset case.
